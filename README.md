# Wilder
Homeschool activity tracking for the wild + free generation

---

### Over the last several years, homeschooling has changed dramatically.

It hardly takes more than a few minutes of searching Instagram for #wildandfree or #unschooling to find an endless stream of families in the woods, at the beach, or on horseback, having their "lesson" for the day.

The only downside to this is that it's still school, which means you still need to keep records. So that's one area that Wilder is aiming to solve. There's compilicated, full-blown curriculum software if you want to go that route, but not only are they expensive, but nobody wants to sit down in front of a big, complicated interface just to put down Blake's piano lesson in the record. They want to grab their phones, tap a few buttons, maybe snap a photo, and get on with their lives.

### So What Does The App Do?

Wilder allows you to record any activity you want, from sports, to music lessons, to robotics club... if it's what you do for school, you can put it down! Just add your activity, pick which one of your kids it was for and how long it took, and you're all set! Wilder will automatically sort and catalog all of your data, and generate reports based on whatever criteria you give it, whenever you want.

### But it doesn't stop there

Homeschooling can be filled with incredible experiences that you want to be able to look back on. Wilder also features a "Field Trip Journal" that allows you to take photos, videos, and write a journal entry for any experience you want to be able to revisit later. And for every entry, it will automatically record that experience (along with a duration, if you set one) for whichever kids were included in the trip/experience/outing/etc.

### Other Features

Reading is an essential part of the vast majority of homeschool families' repertoires, so Wilder also has a Book List feature that will allow you to keep track of what your kids read. In addition to recording books they've already read, you can also add future books that haven't been read yet, set due dates if needed, and even add an incentive or reward for finishing the book on time!

Wilder will also show you an attendance calendar, because one of the most essential and yet most mundane parts of any homeschool parent's life is trying to answer the question of "How many school days have we done so far?". It can be a chore keeping up with which days were school days and which ones weren't, so Wilder will automatically mark any day with an activity or field trip as a school day for that student. Didn't do any activities today? Wilder can ask you if you want to manually mark that day as a school day (and don't worry, you can turn that part off if you'd rather just do it yourself).
